:warning: Think before using


Clone this repository : look ahead for the green button "Clone", a popup should appear, with a "Download ZIP" at the bottom, click on it, once downloaded unzip it.

Download and install Google's Antigravity (you'll figure out how to do it)

Open Antigravity and open the folder you have unzipped.

On the right side you should see a small window where you can chat with Antigravity.

In this chat box type the following : "Follow the instruction of prompt.txt"

Accept all the permissions it asks you.

I just hope It will still work when you read this.
