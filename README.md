Only tested on Mac OS, with proper dependencies already installed.

:warning: Use at your own risk :warning:

## How to use

Clone this repository : look ahead for the green button "Clone", a popup should appear, with a "Download ZIP" at the bottom, click on it, once downloaded unzip it.

Download and install Google's Antigravity (you'll figure out how to do it)

Open Antigravity and open the folder you have unzipped.

On the right side you should see a small window where you can chat with Antigravity.
You should see it is in planning mode : change it to fast mode.

In this chat box, type the following : "Follow the instruction of prompt.txt" and press enter.

Accept all the permissions it asks you : beware you are losing control of your computer ;-)

## What it will produce (if it does not fail because of missing dependencies)

1) in the folder example there is my_text.txt : it will fix any syntaxic errors + add some emojis. the result will appear in the folder output
2) in the folder example there is prompt_image.txt : these are the instructions for the gif you will find in the folder output
